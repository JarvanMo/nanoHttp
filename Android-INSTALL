  nanoHttp INSTALLATION GUIDES  
================================

DISCLAIMER

This is an advanced tool for experienced Android users.
I consider it as a software experiment. Please do NOT use this program in a productive system!



What you need
-------------

- Android device
- Rooted (The device must be rooted)
- ADB bridge
- Knowledge about a shell and the Android system

How to install the program
--------------------------

Copy the program on your device into a directory where you can execute it.
Usually the SD-Card (Internal and External) are marked as Non-Executable. You won't be able to run the program from that location.

Copy the binary into /system/bin. Keep in mind to make the mount-point writeable.
Then copy the binary into /system/bin

# mount -o remount,rw /system
# cp nanoHttp /system/bin/                                            
# mount -o remount,ro /system

Done :-)



Run the program at startup
--------------------------

Create the file '99nanoHttp' in the directory /data/local/userinit.d
# /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp

With the following contents:

#!/system/bin/sh
umask 077
/system/bin/nanoHttp -w /storage/sdcard1/www/


Replace /storage/sdcard1/www/ with the directory where your WWW contents are located.

Don't forget to make /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp executable!

Execute the following to have all together:

echo "#!/system/bin/sh" > /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp
echo "umask 077" >> /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp
echo "/system/bin/nanoHttp -w /storage/sdcard1/www/" >> /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp
chmod 755 /data/local/userinit.d/99nanoHttp
